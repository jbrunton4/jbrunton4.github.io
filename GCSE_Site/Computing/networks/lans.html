            A LAN (Local Aera Network) is made of 2 or more nodes sharing information. There are 3 main ways to set up a LAN:
            <li>A BUS network. These are like one line with multiple nodes along it. It is cheap and easy to set up, but slow (due to data
            having to pass through every node) and data colissions are common as data travels at different speeds both ways. In addition
            to this, one node breaking can break the whole network.</li>
            <li>Ring - these are just like a bus, but a closed shape (circle). Again, it is cheap and easy, but slow and unreliable.</li>
            <li>A STAR topology has a switch (or hub) which manages data, connecting to every node in the network. These are expensive and complex,
            but fast and reliable.</li>

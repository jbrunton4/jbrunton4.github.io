            Raster images are made from pixels (derrived from pixel+element), which are coloured squares on a screen. These are arranged in a way that makes them appear as an image.
            You can compress them 2 ways: Lossy, where pixels are removed (this makes for a smaller file) or lossless, where the image itself is shrunk (this makes for a larger file
            size but a better image once restored). There are many file types for images:
            <li>JPEG / Joint Photographic Experts Group(.jpg)</li>
            <li>Gif / Graphics Interchange Format(.gif)</li>
            <li>BMP / Bitmap (.bmp)</li>
            <li>Tiff / Tagged Image File Format (.tiff)</li>
            <li>PNG / Portable Network Graphic (.png)</li>

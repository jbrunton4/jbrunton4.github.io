            Sound files are made by a microphone sensing small vibrations and taking samples of soundwaves. This is an analog, which a computer can't read, so it
            is put through an ADC to turn it to digital (it must be read at certain points, more frequent sampling maeks for a better sound). Each piece of data
            is given a binary value and stored.
